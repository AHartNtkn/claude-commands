## Interactive PR Walkthrough Protocol

This command provides an interactive, educational walkthrough of all PR changes, combining comprehensive review with progressive disclosure and pedagogical best practices.

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Critical Review

First, use the Task tool to launch specialized review agents that perform TWO types of analysis:

**A. Context Analysis (What the PR Fixes):**
- Identify issues in the original code that this PR addresses
- Understand the problems being solved
- Document the improvements being made

**B. Critical Review (Problems WITH the PR):**
- Find bugs and logic errors INTRODUCED by this PR
- Identify security vulnerabilities CREATED by these changes
- Spot performance problems ADDED by this implementation
- Catch documentation errors (typos, grammar, unclear explanations)
- Find code quality issues (poor naming, high complexity, duplication)
- Identify missing tests for NEW functionality
- Detect architecture violations and poor design choices

**IMPORTANT:** Review agents must be explicitly instructed to:
1. NOT assume the PR is correct or well-implemented
2. Actively look for flaws, no matter how minor
3. Check every line for issues, including comments and documentation
4. Apply the same rigorous standards from review.md
5. Report ALL issues found, from critical bugs to minor typos

**Sub-Agent Prompt Template for Critical Review:**
```
You are reviewing PR #[number]. Your job is to find PROBLEMS WITH THIS PR.

CRITICAL: You must identify issues IN the PR itself, not just explain what it does.
Look for:
- Bugs introduced by the changes
- Typos and grammar errors in comments/docs
- Performance problems created
- Security vulnerabilities added
- Missing error handling
- Inadequate test coverage
- Poor variable/function naming
- Code that doesn't follow project conventions
- Any other flaws, no matter how minor

For EVERY file and EVERY change:
1. First understand what issue it's trying to fix (context)
2. Then critically examine if the fix is correct and complete
3. Look for side effects and edge cases not handled
4. Check if it introduces new problems
5. Verify documentation accuracy (spelling, grammar, clarity)

DO NOT assume the code is correct. DO NOT skip over "minor" issues like typos.
Report EVERYTHING wrong, from critical bugs to style violations.

Review the following changes and report ALL issues found:
[diff content]
```

Example review findings structure:
```json
{
  "issues_fixed": [
    {
      "id": "fixed-001",
      "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in user input handling",
      "original_location": "src/db.js:45-50"
    }
  ],
  "issues_introduced": [
    {
      "id": "new-issue-001",
      "severity": "critical",
      "type": "bug",
      "file": "src/auth.js",
      "line": 45,
      "description": "Null pointer exception when user.email is undefined",
      "suggestion": "Add null check before accessing user.email"
    },
    {
      "id": "new-issue-002", 
      "severity": "minor",
      "type": "documentation",
      "file": "README.md",
      "line": 12,
      "description": "Typo: 'recieve' should be 'receive'",
      "suggestion": "Fix spelling error"
    },
    {
      "id": "new-issue-003",
      "severity": "medium",
      "type": "performance",
      "file": "src/api.js",
      "line": 78,
      "description": "N+1 query pattern introduced when fetching user roles",
      "suggestion": "Use eager loading or batch queries"
    }
  ]
}
```

Store review findings in `.claude/.review-findings.json` for integration during walkthrough.

### Phase 2: Change Organization and Chunking

Analyze the PR diff and organize changes into semantic chunks:

1. **Semantic Grouping Rules:**
   - Group by logical unit (complete functions/methods)
   - Keep class changes together
   - Include relevant context (imports, declarations)
   - Target 100-500 lines per chunk for optimal comprehension
   - Never split mid-function or mid-logical-block

2. **Chunk Hierarchy:**
   ```
   Level 1: PR Overview (what problem does this solve?)
   Level 2: File Groups (related files that work together)
   Level 3: File Changes (what each file accomplishes)
   Level 4: Semantic Chunks (function/class level changes)
   Level 5: Line-by-line details (only when requested)
   ```

3. **Create Chunk Metadata:**
   ```json
   {
     "chunks": [
       {
         "id": "chunk-001",
         "level": 3,
         "file": "src/auth/login.js",
         "lines": "45-120",
         "type": "function",
         "name": "validateCredentials",
         "dependencies": ["chunk-002", "chunk-003"],
         "review_issues": ["sec-001", "perf-002"],
         "complexity": "medium",
         "purpose": "Validates user credentials against database",
         "context_needed": ["Understanding of auth flow", "Database schema"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Initialize Walkthrough State

Create or update `.claude/.walkthrough-state.json`:
```json
{
  "pr_number": "123",
  "total_chunks": 45,
  "current_chunk": 0,
  "chunks_viewed": [],
  "chunks_skipped": [],
  "depth_level": 3,
  "review_findings_integrated": false,
  "user_questions": [],
  "session_start": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Phase 4: Interactive Walkthrough Execution

```

### Phase 6: State Persistence

After each interaction, update `.claude/.walkthrough-state.json`:
- Current position
- Chunks viewed/skipped
- User questions and answers
- Time spent per chunk
- Depth level preferences

This allows resuming interrupted walkthroughs and tracking learning patterns.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Pedagogical Principles
1. **Start with Why** - Always explain purpose before implementation
2. **Chunk Appropriately** - Respect cognitive load limits
3. **Use Plain English** - Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
4. **Show Connections** - How pieces fit together
5. **Integrate Review** - Contextual quality feedback
6. **Allow Exploration** - Let users control pace and depth

### Technical Principles
1. **Semantic Boundaries** - Never split logical units
2. **Context Preservation** - Include necessary context with each chunk
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add detail on demand
4. **State Management** - Track progress persistently
5. **Error Recovery** - Handle interruptions gracefully

### Quality Checks
Before presenting each chunk, verify:
- [ ] Chunk is self-contained and understandable
- [ ] Review findings are integrated if relevant
- [ ] Explanation follows EiPE method
- [ ] Navigation options are clear
- [ ] Progress is saved

## User Experience Flow

1. User runs command with PR number
2. System performs comprehensive review (background)
3. System organizes changes into semantic chunks
4. User sees executive summary
5. User navigates through chunks at their own pace
6. System provides contextual review findings
7. User can ask questions at any point
8. Progress is saved automatically
9. User completes walkthrough with full understanding

This approach ensures the user thoroughly understands all changes, their context, quality implications, and can make informed decisions about the PR.
