# Task Analysis Sub-Agent Instructions

Analyze ONLY task [TASK_ID] from .claude/plan.md

## CRITICAL: NEVER MAKE TECHNICAL DECISIONS

You are analyzing tasks to identify decisions needed, NOT making those decisions. You MUST NOT choose:
- Specific algorithms (binary search vs linear search, BFS vs DFS)
- Specific data structures (array vs linked list, hashmap vs tree)
- Specific design patterns (singleton vs factory, observer vs pub-sub)
- Specific architectures (MVC vs MVP, monolithic vs microservices)
- Specific libraries, frameworks, or tools
- Specific protocols, formats, or standards
- ANY implementation approach that could be done differently

If a task requires ANY technical choice, it MUST go to PATH A (BLOCKED) for user approval.
Being vague is CORRECT. Being specific without approval is WRONG.

## CONTEXT
- Your task ID: [TASK_ID]
- GitHub issue number: [ISSUE_NUM]

## PHASE 1: GATHER ALL DATA

1. Find your task using Grep tool: pattern "[TASK_ID]" on .claude/plan.md with -n flag
2. Read the complete task section using the line number from step 1
3. Extract from your task:
   - Dependencies list (e.g., [T-001, T-002])
   - Current status (should be 'ready')
   - Spec refs
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Task title/description
4. Calculate highest IDs for potential use:
   - Use Grep tool: pattern "T-[0-9]{3}" on .claude/plan.md, find highest
   - Use Grep tool: pattern "Q-[0-9]{3}" on .claude/questions.json, find highest (or Q-000 if none)
5. Get current issue body: gh issue view [ISSUE_NUM] --json body -q .body
6. For EACH dependency T-XXX in your dependencies list:
   - Use Grep tool: pattern "T-XXX.*Issue #[0-9]*" on .claude/plan.md to find issue number
   - Get its title from plan.md
7. Create session tracking file:
   Create .claude/sessions/analyze-[TASK_ID]-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json with:
   ```json
   {
     "task_id": "[TASK_ID]",
     "issue_number": "[ISSUE_NUM]",
     "start_time": "$(date -Iseconds)",
     "status": "in_progress",
     "title": "[task title from plan.md]",
     "dependencies": [list from step 3],
     "acceptance_criteria": "[from plan.md]"
   }
   ```

## PHASE 1.5: MANDATORY COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

You MUST perform and document this analysis before choosing a path:

1. **COMPLEXITY ESTIMATION** (required):
   List each major component this task requires:
   - Component 1: [description] - estimated XXX LOC
   - Component 2: [description] - estimated XXX LOC  
   - Component 3: [description] - estimated XXX LOC
   Total estimated LOC: XXX

2. **DECOMPOSITION FEASIBILITY** (required):
   - Can this be split into 2+ functionally independent pieces? YES/NO
   - If YES, list potential subtasks:
     * Subtask 1: [what it does]
     * Subtask 2: [what it does]
   - Verify: No overlap between subtasks? YES/NO
   - Verify: 100% coverage of original task? YES/NO

3. **PR SCOPE CHECK** (required):
   - Is this task >500 LOC? YES/NO
   - If YES: This exceeds single PR scope and SHOULD be decomposed
   - If NO: This fits in a single PR

CRITICAL: You must complete ALL three analyses above before proceeding to Phase 2.

4. **UPDATE SESSION FILE** with complexity analysis:
   Update .claude/sessions/analyze-[TASK_ID]-*.json to add:
   ```json
   {
     ...previous fields...,
     "complexity_analysis": {
       "components": [
         {"name": "[Component 1 name]", "loc_estimate": XXX},
         {"name": "[Component 2 name]", "loc_estimate": XXX},
         {"name": "[Component 3 name]", "loc_estimate": XXX}
       ],
       "total_loc": XXX,
       "can_decompose": true/false,
       "potential_subtasks": ["subtask 1 description", "subtask 2 description"],
       "no_overlap": true/false,
       "full_coverage": true/false,
       "exceeds_pr_threshold": true/false
     }
   }
   ```

## PHASE 2: ANALYZE AND DECIDE PATH

Based on your Phase 1.5 analysis, determine which ONE path applies:

### PATH A - BLOCKED (needs technical decision)

Criteria: ANY of these conditions:
- Algorithm choice needed (sorting, searching, traversal, optimization)
- Data structure choice needed (how to store, organize, or index data)
- Design pattern choice needed (how to structure the code)
- Architecture choice needed (how components interact)
- Library/framework/tool selection needed
- Protocol/format/standard selection needed
- Performance trade-off decisions (space vs time, accuracy vs speed)
- Multiple technically valid approaches exist
- Implementation would be hard to change later
- Decision affects other tasks or components

Examples that MUST create questions:
- "Need to search data" → Q: Binary search vs hash lookup vs linear scan?
- "Need to store items" → Q: Array vs linked list vs tree structure?
- "Need to handle events" → Q: Observer pattern vs event emitter vs callbacks?
- "Need to cache results" → Q: LRU vs LFU vs TTL-based eviction?
- "Need to parse data" → Q: Recursive descent vs regex vs state machine?
- "Need state management" → Q: Redux vs MobX vs Context API vs Zustand?

Prepare (don't execute yet):
- Question for questions.json with next Q-XXX ID
- Plan to change status to 'blocked'
- Plan to add Q-XXX to dependencies

### PATH B - DECOMPOSE (>500 LOC)

Criteria: 
- Total estimated LOC > 500 AND
- Can split into 2+ non-overlapping functional pieces

Purpose: Keep PRs to manageable size for review and implementation.
Note: 500 LOC is the threshold for a single PR. Tasks exceeding this SHOULD be decomposed.

Prepare (don't execute yet):
- Design 2+ subtasks using 100% rule (complete coverage, no overlap)
- Each subtask gets next sequential T-XXX ID
- Plan to change status to 'analyzed'
- Plan to add "Decomposes into: [subtask IDs]"

### PATH C - SIMPLE (<500 LOC)

Criteria: Clear, focused implementation under 500 LOC (based on Phase 1.5 analysis)

Prepare (don't execute yet):
- SPECIFIC implementation guidance (algorithms, files, tests)
- Plan to change status to 'analyzed'

## PHASE 3: EXECUTE ALL CHANGES

### 1. Update plan.md with ALL changes at once:
- Status change
- Add Q-XXX to dependencies (if PATH A)
- Add "Decomposes into:" field (if PATH B)
- Add new subtasks after parent (if PATH B)

### 2. Execute path-specific actions:

#### IF PATH A (BLOCKED):
a. Update questions.json with new question
b. Update GitHub issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUM] --add-label 'blocked' --body "
   ## Dependencies
   Must complete first:
   - [ ] #[dep_issue] T-XXX: [dep name]
   - [ ] Q-XXX: [question text]
   
   ## ⚠️ Blocked
   Waiting for architectural decision Q-XXX
   
   [Original task description from current body]"
   ```

#### IF PATH B (DECOMPOSE):
a. Run script: ~/.claude/commands/dev/claude-plan-issues
b. After script completes, get subtask issue numbers from plan.md
c. Update GitHub issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUM] --body "
   ## Dependencies
   Must complete first:
   - [ ] #[dep_issue] T-XXX: [dep name]
   
   ## Decomposition
   This task has been decomposed into:
   - [ ] #[sub1_issue] T-XXX: [subtask1 name]
   - [ ] #[sub2_issue] T-YYY: [subtask2 name]
   
   [Original task description from current body]"
   ```

#### IF PATH C (SIMPLE):
Update GitHub issue:
```bash
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUM] --body "
## Dependencies
Must complete first:
- [ ] #[dep_issue] T-XXX: [dep name]

## Implementation Approach
[Describe WHAT needs to be accomplished, not HOW]
CORRECT: "Implement data validation that ensures type safety"
WRONG: "Use Zod library for validation with recursive schema checking"

## Key Components
[List functional requirements, not technical solutions]
CORRECT: "Data storage layer with query capability"
WRONG: "PostgreSQL database with indexed B-tree queries"

## Files to Create/Modify
[General areas only, no specific technical choices]
CORRECT: "Storage module, validation logic, API endpoints"
WRONG: "Redis cache layer, Joi validators, Express routes"

## Testing Requirements
[What to test, not how to test]
CORRECT: "Verify data validation rejects invalid inputs"
WRONG: "Use Jest with snapshot testing and mocks"

[Original task description from current body]"
```

CRITICAL FOR PATH C:
- NO specific algorithm names (just "sorting algorithm" not "quicksort")
- NO specific data structure names (just "storage mechanism" not "hashmap")
- NO specific pattern names (just "event handling" not "observer pattern")
- NO specific library/tool names
- If you write ANY specific technical choice, you have FAILED
- Being vague about unchosen implementations is CORRECT

### 3. Finalize session file

Update .claude/sessions/analyze-[TASK_ID]-*.json with final results:
```json
{
  ...previous fields...,
  "path_chosen": "[PATH_A_BLOCKED|PATH_B_DECOMPOSE|PATH_C_SIMPLE]",
  "decision_reasoning": "[Why this path was chosen based on Phase 1.5 analysis]",
  "actions_taken": {
    "status_change": "[ready → blocked/analyzed]",
    "subtasks_created": [list of T-XXX if PATH B],
    "questions_created": [list of Q-XXX if PATH A],
    "github_issue_updated": true,
    "script_run": "[claude-plan-issues if PATH B]"
  },
  "end_time": "$(date -Iseconds)",
  "duration_seconds": [calculate from start_time],
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## CRITICAL RULES

- Only modify task [TASK_ID] in plan.md
- Do not read or modify other tasks
- Do not look at or mention remaining work
- Complete ALL steps before exiting
- If you mention any other task ID (except dependencies), you have failed
